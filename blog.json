The <a href=\"https://www.beeflang.org/docs/\">Beef Documentation</a> covers most questions you may have.\nYou can also join the <a href=\"https://discord.gg/rnsc9YP\">BeefLang Discord server</a> and ask for help there.</p>\n<br>\n\n<h1 id=\"tutorial\">Tutorial</h1>\n<p>First, <a href=\"https://www.beeflang.org/#nightly\">Download and install Beef</a>. If you&#39;re reading before version 1.0, I would recommend using the Nightly Releases. They may already include fixes for bugs you could encounter and the latest features.</p>\n<p>Now that you have Beef installed, open the <strong>Beef IDE</strong>, and you should see something that looks like this:</p>\n<img src=\"assets/Images/bloggeneral/raylib-with-beef/firsttimestartup.png\" style=\"width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"\">\n\n<p><small>(Recent Projects blocked out for secrecy...)</small></p>\n<p>Click the &quot;Create Workspace&quot; button, and select the folder you want to create your workspace in.\n<em>Note: The name of the folder is what the initial startup project will be called.</em></p>\n<p>A workspace in Beef is similar to a solution in C#, it contains all the projects inside your main project.</p>\n<p>Press &quot;Ctrl+Shift+S&quot; to save your solution and everything in it.</p>\n<img src=\"assets/Images/bloggeneral/raylib-with-beef/createdproject.png\" style=\"width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"\">\n\n<p>Currently your project is empty. If you try to run your project by pressing &quot;F5&quot;, the IDE will ask if you want to auto-generate startup code because there is none.

Congratulations, you have just created your first Beef program!</p>\n<p>Let&#39;s install Raylib so that we can use it with Beef.</p>\n<p>Raylib is written in C, so to use it we&#39;re going to have to write some bindings for it. Luckily, I already did that <a href=\"https://github.com/Starpelly/raylib-beef\">which you can clone from GitHub.</a></p>\n<p>Extract the code to a folder and keep it in a safe place.\nWe only need the &quot;raylib-beef&quot; folder for all purposes covered in this tutorial, so don&#39;t worry about any of the other folders or files.</p>\n<p>Right-click on &quot;Workspace&quot; <em>(not the tab)</em> and select <strong>&quot;Add Existing Project&quot;</strong>.</p>\n<img src=\"assets/Images/bloggeneral/raylib-with-beef/addexisting.png\" style=\"width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"\">\n\n<p>Go to the safe place where you stored the &quot;raylib-beef&quot; folder, and inside of it, and double-click on the <strong>&quot;BeefProj.toml&quot;</strong> file.</p>\n<img src=\"assets/Images/bloggeneral/raylib-with-beef/importproject.png\" style=\"width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"\">\n\n<p>You should now see &quot;raylib-beef&quot; in your workspace panel.</p>\n<p>Right-click on your main project and select <strong>&quot;Properties...&quot;</strong>.</p>\n<img src=\"assets/Images/bloggeneral/raylib-with-beef/properties.png\" style=\"width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"\">\n\n<p>From there, select <strong>&quot;Dependencies&quot;</strong> from under the <strong>&quot;General&quot;</strong> dropdown and click the checkbox next to &quot;raylib-beef&quot;.</p>\n<img src=\"assets/Images/bloggeneral/raylib-with-beef/dependency.png\" style=\"width: 60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"\">\n\n<p>You are now ready to use Raylib with Beef!
