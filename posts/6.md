Since December of last year I have been working on this fan project. It 100% done by me up to late January. I found developing it really fun and intuitive, especially considering the amount of recognition it was getting. The pure quality and speed of which people are working on it are incredible.

It has been a bit of a burden on my mental health though, I had to balance my work with it. But it does add a bit of challenge to life that isn't soul-crushing I guess.
On the topic I also made a Discord server, which has been in a bit of drama recently. I don't want to go too in-depth about it. But I'm trying to resolve that. Maybe it will be fine. I don't want my personal political beliefs to impact a project made for a niche community.
