Hello, It's been quite a while, hasn't it? Over a year since my last update on anything.

Let's start with an update on the Motionmelody editor. It's completely different now, with a waveform and full undo-redo support. We can finally make Darude - Sandstorm properly.

At this point, I'm about 60% done with the game. It's taking me a little longer than I would've liked, but it's definitely better than what I showed before.
