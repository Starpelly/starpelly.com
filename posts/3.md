On June 12th, 2021 me and a friend created Boxsubmus. A game studio specifically for the game we have been wanting to develop for a long time. Unfortunately we had to delay those plans to finding out a very similar game has already existed for quite some time now.

I wont be going too much over detail, just know that we have to change quite a lot about out original plan. We don't plan on changing the story or core formula, but it is a bit demotivating to know we're gonna have to start from scratch again.


We don't have any plans of stopping, but our time is scarce due to school starting back up in a few days. In a way I'm kinda grateful we didn't put all of our effort into it.


You can follow us for more updates, if interested of course.
