{"html":"<p>Gridbeats is dead, and Rhythm Heaven Mania has been given to someone else. So now what? Well, obviously I&#39;m going back to the simple life of visual effects and making video games. It was truly a fun time, but I have other things I need to do. Hopefully the Rhythm Heaven community can have fun with that while willfully curb stomping an autistic man for using the wrong word in a button on his niche blog website.</p>\n<p>Anyway, what do I have planned for the future? Well, namely a game engine. Appropriately called &quot;Starflow&quot;. It&#39;s primary purpose is stylish 3D and rhythm games. Originally created for Rhythm Heaven Mania it will now serve as the main game engine for Boxsubmus... when It&#39;s done anyway.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/H2Sofos.png\" style=\"width: 90%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"\">\n\n<p>Of course, this is all super early on, I&#39;ve only been working on it for a week. Who knows what it will be like in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"regarding-my-youtube-channel\">Regarding my YouTube channel</h2>\n<p>More likely than not, I&#39;m probably just gonna go back to YTPMV&#39;s. I had the most fun out of all the stuff I do currently, making them than ANYTHING I do now.</p>\n<p>I remember when I tried using my channel as a resource for the Rhythm Heaven soundtrack. I realized I could just make it all one video instead, and then I realized someone else was doing the same thing anyway. So I bailed on that plan. The community post is still up though for some reason, I might delete that some time never.</p>\n<p>Anyway yeah, I&#39;m going back to do the things I love. And I won&#39;t let anyone stop me. I&#39;ll see you in the next 4 months.</p>\n","title":"We're back!","slug":"were-back","date":"2/22/2022"}
