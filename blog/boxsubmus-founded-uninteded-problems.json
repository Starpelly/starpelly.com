{"html":"<p>On June 12th, 2021 me and a friend created Boxsubmus. A game studio specifically for the game we have been wanting to develop for a long time. Unfortunately we had to delay those plans to finding out a very similar game has already existed for quite some time now.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://store.steampowered.com/widget/1228610/\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"646\" height=\"190\"></iframe>\n\n<p>I wont be going too much over detail, just know that we have to change quite a lot about out original plan. We don&#39;t plan on changing the story or core formula, but it is a bit demotivating to know we&#39;re gonna have to start from scratch again.</p>\n<p>We don&#39;t have any plans of stopping, but our time is scarce due to school starting back up in a few days. In a way I&#39;m kinda grateful we didn&#39;t put all of our effort into it.</p>\n<p>You can follow us for more updates, if interested of course.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/boxsubmus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" class=\"twitter-follow-button\" data-show-count=\"false\">Follow @boxsubmus</a><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n","title":"Boxsubmus Founded + Unintended Problems","slug":"boxsubmus-founded-uninteded-problems","date":"8/1/2021"}
