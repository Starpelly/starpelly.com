{"html":"<p>If you didn&#39;t know, After Effects has these things called &quot;Layer Styles&quot;. These are similar, but are NOT the same as effects. As layer styles are applied after everything else. <img src=\"assets/Images/tutorials/custom stroke/1.png\" style=\"width: 90%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"\"> I will go more in-depth about layer styles in a future tutorial, but this should give you the basics of all you really need to know right now.  </p>\n<p>Clicking on stroke you can see that it will apply a very simple &quot;outline&quot; effect. If you&#39;ve ever used a program like Photoshop this might seem familiar.  </p>\n<p>However you seem to notice something when motion blur is applied. \n<img src=\"assets/Images/tutorials/custom stroke/2.png\" style=\"width: 90%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"\">\nThe motion blur does not effect the stroke style we added. :(<br>Luckily for us effects are here to not make us bang our head against the fucking table.  </p>\n<p>Copy my settings here. <img src=\"assets/Images/tutorials/custom stroke/3.png\" style=\"width: 50%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"\"> All this basically does is &quot;mask&quot; the transparent part of our clip with blue, Keylight will key out the blue, and the &quot;Screen Matte&quot; will expand the key-ed out background and replace it with the &quot;Replace Colour&quot;. You can mess with the settings if you want. I would also recommend creating a user-made-preset since you might be using this a lot.  </p>\n<p>Seeing as the effect is now applied BEFORE the motion blur, it will now be effected by it. <img src=\"assets/Images/tutorials/custom stroke/4.png\" style=\"width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","title":"Custom Stroke in After Effects","slug":"custom-stroke-in-ae","date":"4/8/2021"}
