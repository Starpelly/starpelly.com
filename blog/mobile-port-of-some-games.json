{"html":"<p>Appropriately after Rhythm Heaven Mania I decided to dip my toes into some mobile games.\nNow I&#39;ve never made a mobile game before, so I have no idea what to expect. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot of fun to be had though.</p>\n<p>The games I decided to port was the &quot;Endless Games&quot; from Rhythm Heaven DS. I always found these fun enough and small enough to port to a mobile phone, especially if they&#39;re use something easy to grasp like the &quot;flicking&quot; mechanic.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XI971vQ.png\" style=\"width: 90%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"\">\n\n<p>My mom already playtested it, and with no prior knowledge to Rhythm Heaven she pretty much mastered it in a matter of minutes.\nThat COULD be because it might be too easy, but I don&#39;t know I would have to look into it.</p>\n","title":"Mobile port of some games","slug":"mobile-port-of-some-games","date":"3/4/2022"}
