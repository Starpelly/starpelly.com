While my body is sweating and my head hurts, I stare at my screen wondering why am I doing this? Making a video game for people to play and toss away next minute.
"I just want to go to sleep", I say while I continue working at the bug I've been tackling for the past 4 hours. Twitter is open on my other monitor just to piss
me off more. Nothing about this is healthy.

After many hours of work, the problem as been resolved, and I look at the game in its state. Unfinished, but full of potential. It's when I remember why I do this.

I haven't eaten in days, and yet I sit here more, waiting to complete my creation; because that's what I want.

Work on Motionmelody continues slowly. Maybe one day, it will finally be completed.
