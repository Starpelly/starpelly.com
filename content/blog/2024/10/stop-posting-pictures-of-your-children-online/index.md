One thing I've noticed more and more as I've grown older, is that adults are surprisingly stupid! Mothers will get their
infant boy's penis mutilated for no reason other than *aesthetics*. My own parents made a lot of stupid decisions while
raising me that in *my* view, didn't need to be made. I don't think of myself as a smart person, so most of this might
just be hubris.

The biggest problem I have with most parents these days is the obsession with posting their children on social media
for everyone else to see. It's just very sad, I don't know what goes through these parent's minds. It's a level of
narcissism rivaled only by IVF and surrogacy. How much disrespect must you have for your children's privacy to just post
them on the clear-web for every weird pervert to have access to? This is a very big reason I'm not completely pro-parental rights.

I'm very grateful I was born before this point.
