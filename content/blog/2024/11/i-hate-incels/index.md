**TOTAL INCEL DEATH**. Kill incels. Behead incels. Roundhouse kick an incel to the concrete.

Do you know what I hate more than a loser? A loser who makes it everyone else's problem. That's a loser that can only be generated from an advanced strain of autism! The kind of autism I see from Twitter daily that would kill a small victorian child. A strain of autism plaguing unchallenged in our communities, and President Reagan isn't even doing anything about it!

These autistic losers are called "incels", and they are by far, the uncontested worst group of people on Earth. *Along with crypto-bros taking a close 2nd place.*

These "people" are *just* autistic enough to be socially stigmatized, but also *not* autistic enough to make actual good uses out of their autism. As a result, these "people" have decided to dedicate their entire lives to infiltrating anything and everything they can think of with their bitching and whining, with the ultimate goal of spreading misery to as many civilized and normal people as possible.

I've started noticing this trend more commonly amongst Christian circles (as I am Christian). Since like 2021, a lot of these "people" have started infiltrating churches in hopes of finding a "wife". The women at these churches aren't looking for husbands, they're there to worship God. I think the biggest victim of this problem is The Eastern Orthodox Church, which is currently being flooded by the autist-tsunami.

A member of one of The Eastern Orthodox Church has decided to make a tweet calling them out:

He got harassed by one of these retards over his objectively reasonable tweet:

<small>To be fair, this guy claims to not be Christian, but you can <a href="https://x.com/AudioScribeOW/status/1855022430026334378">read the replies yourself if you want more examples.</a></small>

Good news is, this problem is mostly self-solving, as most of these men are ready to just move to a different church the moment their views are challenged; but that's not the point. I'm sick and tired of seeing these losers all day harass women and participate in other homosexual behavior.

As an asexual ["volcel"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/volcel), I hold the opinion that if there were any reason to be mad at women, "I can't get bitches" has to be the shittiest and least valid. Women were literally designed by God to follow men. If you are incapable of drawing women towards you, you were always destined to be alone. If you can't handle that fact, kill yourself.

Isolation is a choice. Stop being a loser.
