I think we take websites like YouTube for granted, a centralized ecosystem where anyone from anywhere in the world can upload *mostly* any video they want and anyone else in the world can watch that video instantly, it's amazing, really. However, I want to remind you of something, this website **will** die someday.

I don't know when, I don't know how, but it will, and I know this for one good reason:

### YouTube's existence is dependent on continuous funding.
YouTube relies on Google to survive, it's like YouTube's oxygen, and according to Google, they've been running YouTube at a loss for years. Eventually, (like years down the line...) Google will recognize the reality of thir situation and YouTube will shutdown for good.

So, why am I telling you this? Well, I want to bring up something that has been annoying me for the past few years now, something which I believe is a cancer of the Internet and the preservation of media: **Discord**.

## Why Discord Is a Freaking Cancer That Needs To Die A Horrible Death

For years now, Discord has been dependent on their one external funding, mainly their 'Discord Nitro' service. And, it's incredibly clear to me that this is not a reliable means of income.

Discord is *always* trying some shady new thing or *gimmick* to entice people and get them to subscribe to Nitro. Either through

If I need to join a random Discord Server to accomplish what could've been a simple download link, I'm going to ignore your project. Actually, I'm not just going to ignore your project, I will *personally* tell other people to *avoid* your project.
