Appropriately after Rhythm Heaven Mania I decided to dip my toes into some mobile games.
Now I've never made a mobile game before, so I have no idea what to expect. I'm sure there's a lot of fun to be had though.

The games I decided to port was the "Endless Games" from Rhythm Heaven DS. I always found these fun enough and small enough to port to a mobile phone, especially if they're use something easy to grasp like the "flicking" mechanic.

My mom already playtested it, and with no prior knowledge to Rhythm Heaven she pretty much mastered it in a matter of minutes.
That COULD be because it might be too easy, but I don't know I would have to look into it.
