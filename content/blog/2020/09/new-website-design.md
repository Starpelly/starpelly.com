Blog is set up, and funny thing is it runs off Github Pages. There really isn't much to say as of right now. But I'll update this frequently with new information and tutorials. !

For now have this banana. But expect a lot more in the future, I will totally make this wait worthwhile. Also you can click one of those tabs on the right hand side for more links to other stuff. Mainly just random sites and things I could think of. I was hoping it would add to the site, and the only thing it really added was loading time.

Anyway I spent way too long on this, expect more from me soon. Thank you!
