A couple weeks ago, I made and released a small Minesweeper clone with the initial goal of recreating that classic "Tetris" game loop. The results were quite excellent if you ask me.

You can play it for yourself in the browser here:

A big thanks to Darkener for playtesting the game and kinda co-designing.

It only took about six days to complete, starting from scratch. I have no idea if that's considered a long time for a game this small. I was going to make an Android port, and to be honest, I still mightâ€”but that's for another day.
