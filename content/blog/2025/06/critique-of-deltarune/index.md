Spoilers, obviously.

## Chapter 3 was fun, actually

{{< img src="freedumb.jpg" style="width: 45%" caption="And I LIKED the writing, too!" >}}

I actually *really* liked chapter 3! But *some people* think it was really slow, or it didn't advance the story enough...

And by *some people*, I mean [4chan retards](https://i.imgur.com/IdwQPvC.jpeg).

## "Kris is nonbinary" bullshit

{{< img src="quote-what-can-be-asserted-without-evidence-can-be-dismissed-without-evidence-christopher-hitchens-13-33-53.jpg" style="width: 65%" caption="My favorite dipshit atheist." >}}

There's this pervasive idea floating around the Deltarune community. It's been spreading for years, and it's always made me scratch my head. The idea that Kris is "nonbinary".

I don't know where this idea came from, I don't know why it's so prevalent, and I don't know why it's treated as indisputable fact, despite there being absolutely ***no*** evidence to this assertion.

The assumption is that *because* people refer to Kris using they/them pronouns, the assumption must be that their gender identity must conform to a structure which is neither here nor there.

I have three main arguments against this:

1) "Nonbinary" shouldn't be assumed to be the default. If an argument is to be made that just because a character dates the opposite sex doesn't make them heterosexual, it's completely hypocritical to insinuate that just because a character portrays themselves androgynously must make them nonbinary. To claim otherwise would be hypocrisy.
2) Toby has never confirmed this, nor was this ever stated or hinted at in the game (so far).
3) Even if Kris officially chooses to go by they/them and it's not just supposed to make being a stand in for the player, that still doesn't confirm anything about his/her gender identity.

So, please don't argue with me about "misgendering" Kris or being transphobic. Just like how a cop needs a warrant to enter your house, you need evidence for your assertions or else ***you will*** be told to fuck off.

## "The SA scene"

Okay, so, in the ["Weird Route"](https://deltarune.fandom.com/wiki/Snowgrave_Route), during Chapter 4... *blah blah blah*

It was already patched, but here's a video of the scene:

So, if you're like me, you might be confused wondering what exactly the problem is. "How is this insinuating sexual assault?"
