I don't trust credit cards. I don't even like the fundamental concept of them.

Economies have almost always functioned through debt. This is not a new concept. It's so old, in fact, that the Bible directly commands against it multiple times!

[When Senators Josh Hawley & Bernie Sanders introduced a bill capping credit card interest rates at 10%](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-hawley-introduce-bill-capping-credit-card-interest-rates-at-10/), a bunch of dipshit conservatives really clutched their pearls about it. Saying things like ***BuT lEsS pEOpLE WIlL HAvE CREDIT CaAAARRDS!!!!***

In conclusion, credit cards are literally *literally* works of the Antichrist. Just use Cash App.
