Ever since I was a small child, I can remember thinking getting frontpaged on Newgrounds was the thing you did when you "made it".

Well, I finally achieved that goal. After trying a total of one (1) time. Honestly, I should be proud of myself, and I am!

I ended up updating the game 6 times between the time it was updated and today. Honestly, it was fun missing work because I spent all night trying to implement the Newgrounds API, just so I could have leaderboards on the bottom of the page nobody cares about. That's called *priorities*.
