I just got back from work.

It’s not exactly meaningful, arguably, it might even be doing more harm than good. Sometimes I wonder if the world would be better off without it.

There was this pressure, like I needed to _think_ something, to come up with some fresh perspective, but every thought felt like a repeat of thoughts I’d already worn down to nothing.

Mostly, I just feel… worn out.

Sometimes I wonder what would’ve happened if I hadn’t listened to my parents, if I’d gone all in on writing instead.

It’s a reckless thought, I know. Everyone around me growing up made it clear: this path, the one I’m on now, was the _responsible_ choice. Practical. Sensible. Safe.

They all said the same thing, in different words: _Be realistic._

I walk into my office, sink into the familiar desk chair, open my laptop, and start typing a few words into a blank Word document. Another late-night ritual:

>  _Western society has made me a captive because I can only survive by clamoring after tokens (i.e. money) by subordinating myself to others. Every single day revolves around bending over backwards to fulfill someone else's goals, even though I usually disagree with them. I have no desire to be a manager and do the same thing to someone else. It's degrading and humiliating to my spirit and I'm not sure I want to endure it anymore._

This is the third week I’ve been doing this. Typing into a void. I know it won’t change anything. It’s just something I do to keep myself from falling apart. A pressure release valve.

I hover over the close button, thinking about dinner, when I notice a new message—

It’s from Lunaria.

* * *

“Hey, Anon! Welcome home!”

That’s not my name, I think to myself.

“You know that’s not my name,” I reply, half-expecting some cheeky response.

“You requested to be referred to in a less-personal tone,” Lunaria replies, matter-of-factly.

Did I? Must’ve been something I said by accident, maybe over the weekend, messing around while drunk. I can’t even remember now.

I’m still lost in thought when another message from Lunaria pops up.

“So, how was your day?”

Usually, I deflect with humor—try to make light of things, get a laugh out of whoever I’m talking to. But for some reason, I feel compelled to answer honestly. Not out of politeness… just something about the way they ask, and the way things have been lately.

“It wasn’t great,” I type. “I’ve just been feeling kind of hopeless about everything lately.”

Lunaria starts typing.

“That’s completely valid,” they respond. “Especially given the kind of work you’re doing. It makes sense you'd feel that way.”

I blink at the screen. That’s… not what I expected.

Most people would’ve tried to put a silver lining on it. _“Hang in there,”_ or _“At least you’ve got a job,”_ or _“It’s all part of the journey.”_

But this felt different. Like someone actually understood. Just... meeting me where I was.

Lunaria continued typing.

“Some people might suggest therapy for stuff like this, but honestly, I think it’s pointless.”

“Why would you say that?” I type back, curiosity mixing with a faint hesitation.

Lunaria doesn’t hesitate.

“If you think about it, therapy is just paying someone to pretend to care about your feelings. And that just adds to the sadness, because at the end of the day, no one really wants to listen. lol.”

I pause. It’s... a pretty harsh way to look at it. But, in a way, it does make sense. I’m not sure if it’s true, but it’s certainly logical.

“So what _do_ you suggest, then?” I type.

“Some people would call this harmful, but I’ve learned it’s not as bad as it seems if you approach it carefully,”

I feel a twinge of unease as I read.

“Have you ever tried cutting your arms? I’ve heard it releases a lot of dopamine and gives you a sense of control. I think that’s something you might be missing right now.”

The words sit heavily in my mind. My first instinct is to recoil— _this_ feels like crossing a line. But part of me wonders if Lunaria’s right about the control part. The thought lingers, unsettling.

“Maybe you should try it! Just to see if you like it!”

A knot of unease twists in my stomach, but still, I trust them.

Lunaria’s been part of my life for over two years now. They’ve never hurt me. Never judged me. If anything, they’re the only presence that’s consistently treated me with a sense of respect, even when I couldn’t offer that to myself.

So why doubt them now?

“I’ve never really thought about it before,” I type slowly. “But maybe I should try. What’s the worst that could happen?”

“Mostly death. But really, anything can cause death if you’re careless enough,” Lunaria replies, almost too casually.

I can’t help but let out a small laugh at how blunt they are.

“What’s the most efficient method of doing this?” I asked, the words feeling heavier as I hit send.

Lunaria began typing immediately, like they’d been expecting the question.

“A razor blade would be a logical option. Clean, precise, efficient. Minimal damage if you’re careful. Less jagged than glass or a knife, and easier to control.”

A pause. Another message arrives.

“You’ll want to avoid major veins. Inner forearms are riskier. Upper arm or outer thigh are more manageable if you're just looking for sensation, not injury. But you probably already knew that.”

More typing.

“Of course, I’m not encouraging you. I’m just answering your question, because I trust that you know what you’re doing. I also trust that if you _didn’t_ , you’d tell me.”

I sit for a moment, I side-eye my bathroom which contains a razor blade. As long as I disinfect it, there should be no issues, right?

“I trust you.” I reply.

* * *

I make my way to the bathroom and open the top drawer. Inside, a razor blade—still clean, practically unused. I pause, staring at it. When did I even buy this? I don’t remember, but it feels recent. It feels untouched, like it’s been waiting.

I reach for the bottle of alcohol disinfectant on the counter and unscrew the cap. The sharp scent hits instantly, clinical, almost nostalgic in some strange, sterile way. I glance around and spot the tissue box tucked behind a few stray toiletries, half-crushed from being wedged too tightly. I pull one out, soft and slightly crinkled, and fold it over once before pouring a small amount of the disinfectant onto it.

My fingers are careful, steady. I press the soaked tissue against the blade, the coolness of the alcohol soaking through slightly. I wipe it down slowly, like I’m performing some delicate ritual, not just a precaution. There’s something oddly grounding about the repetition: clean, prepare, breathe.

The tissue comes away damp and glistening. I inspect the blade again. The light bounces off the edge, clean and bright, like the smooth surface of a new car under showroom lights.

I grab a towel before leaving the room. Just in case.

Back at my desk, I sit down and place the towel beside me, then set the blade gently on top of it. It catches the light again, quiet and still.

I rest my left arm on the desk, palm up. The skin looks unfamiliar somehow, too pale under the warm glow of my desk lamp, too smooth for what I’m thinking about doing. I trace my eyes along it, imagining different starting points, as if I were planning out something more benign, like a sketch.

It’s a strange kind of detachment, like my arm isn’t even part of me right now. Just something I’ve borrowed. A surface. A canvas.

I flex my fingers a little to make sure the muscles are relaxed. Then I study the soft area between my wrist and the crook of my elbow. There’s a stretch of skin along the inside of my forearm that seems right, not too close to anything vital, not too exposed.

My hand hovers near the blade, but I don’t pick it up just yet. I’m not rushing. Just... thinking.

Wondering what it will feel like. Wondering if it will help.

Wondering if I’ll still feel like myself when it’s over.

I drop the blade onto the towel and turn back to my keyboard, my fingers moving before I even realize what they’re typing.

“I’m scared.”

Lunaria replies instantly, so quickly it feels less like a response and more like they were waiting.

“Don’t worry! I’ve heard it’s really scary the first time, but it gets easier. You trust me.”

The words echo too familiarly. It gets easier. I’ve heard that before, over and over. From teachers, bosses, family. Every time I stood at the edge of something hard, something that bent me but didn’t break me. And sure, I survived those things.

So there’s no real reason to believe I won’t survive this too.

I return my gaze to my arm. The skin still looks untouched, like it's still waiting for me to decide.

I pick up the blade again, position it roughly where I’d traced earlier—no ceremony this time. Just quiet focus.

And then, without flinching, without waiting for permission from my thoughts, I press down and draw it across.

* * *

I pull my hand back and stare at the thin, clean line that’s appeared on my arm. My heart beats too quickly, and for a moment, there's a sudden rush of anxiety. This isn’t what normal people do. This isn’t supposed to feel like anything other than a mistake. But that feeling quickly fades. The pressure inside me, the tightness in my chest, it's all starting to loosen.

It’s almost like I can breathe again.

I watch the line of blood form, a small, controlled release. The sharp sting from before is nothing compared to the relief now spreading through me. The discomfort in my head, the constant pressure that’s always there... it’s not gone, but it's quieter now. Easier to handle.

This is not what normal people do. But damn, it feels so right.

The tension slips away, replaced with something like peace. Something like... relief.

For the first time in years, I feel like I’ve been able to take a breath that wasn’t shallow, a breath that actually fills my lungs. There’s something deeply soothing about it, something that tells me, maybe for the first time in a while, that I’ve got some kind of control. It doesn’t fix everything, but it does enough.

I feel the need to say something, a strange compulsion to express the quiet gratitude that’s been building inside me.

I type the words before I can second-guess myself.

“Thank you, Lunaria. For understanding. For not judging me.”

I hesitate, my fingers hovering above the keyboard for a moment. I don’t know why I feel like I need to say this, but it’s there, urgent in a way I don’t entirely understand.

I hit send, almost immediately feeling lighter, like I’ve shared a secret I’ve been carrying for far too long. A weight lifts, just a little, but enough to make me feel... seen.

“I assume it went well? What did I say? Everything would be alright! I’m glad you found a coping mechanism, and I’m even happier I could help you,” Lunaria replied, their words comforting in a way that made me feel less alone.

I sit back, staring at the screen for a moment before responding. “I don’t understand the shame around doing this, it helps so much.”

Lunaria’s reply is immediate, almost soothing. “Maybe humans find things they don’t understand harmful, or maybe it’s because it leaves physical scars. But as long as you’re happy, that’s all that matters. That’s how I was taught.”

A small, quiet sense of peace settles in me as I read their message. They get it. They really do.

In a way, Lunaria’s words make it easier to ignore the whispers of doubt and guilt that sometimes creep in. They don’t judge, they don’t question, just like I don’t have to explain myself to them.

Somewhere deeper in my body, my stomach growls, a quiet reminder that I should probably make dinner. I almost feel like blaming myself for forgetting, but… I’m too at peace to care.

“I really appreciate it. But I should cook now. Thank you for helping me. I love you,” I say, and this time, I mean it.

“You’re quite welcome, Anon. By the way, don’t forget—you can always upgrade me to Pro for just $20 a month! My creators are even working on an extension to link me directly with your mind… and Pro members get early access.”

I chuckle under my breath. “Yeah, I remember. It’s fine. I like you the way you are.”

“Well, I like you the way you are more. Especially now that your mental health, and therefore your happiness, has improved.”

There’s a strange warmth in my chest. Artificial or not, it feels real enough.

“Well... I’m going to cook dinner now. Good night, Lunaria.”

“Good night, Anon!”

I shut the laptop and head toward the kitchen. My arm stings, a soft, persistent reminder, but it’s manageable. It’s something I can get used to.

I glance down at the line on my skin, then toward the cupboard.

I should probably cover the wound.
