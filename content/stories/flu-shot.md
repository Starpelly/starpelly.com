There’s very little traffic tonight. It’s usually not this quiet; it feels almost liminal.

I won’t complain, I’m happier without it.

I pull into the driveway. My wife’s car isn’t here.

That’s fine. I’m happier without her.

I step inside, straight to the kitchen. The fridge hums at me. No beer.

That’s fine. I’m happier sober.

In the living room, I sink into my favorite chair. It snaps beneath me.

That’s fine. Standing is healthier anyway.

I try the TV. A message appears: “Your account has been disabled due to insufficient payments.”

That’s fine. TV rots your brain.

I’m hungry. I check the pantry. There’s only a can of SpaghettiOs. Money has been tight.

That’s fine. I’m happier when I’m humble.

I pour some into one of the few bowls we have and put it in the microwave.

Arthur would like some. He’s had a long day at school.

I go upstairs and knock on his door. Three times.

…

…

…

Silence.

I knock again, louder.

“Hey, Arthur. I made you dinner.”

…

…

…

No answer.

Maybe he’s not home. I got here late.

He can’t be mad; we just talked last night.

Maybe he’s asleep. I don’t want to wake him.

I have an idea. I’ll leave him a voicemail. He can eat the leftovers later.

I pull out my phone and call him. I expect a voicemail.

His phone rings on the other side of the door. Loud.

Loud enough to wake anyone.

I worry I woke him.

…

…

…

No one answers.

No sign of life.

Is he in the bathroom? Phones in bathrooms are unusual.

I just really have an urge to tell him.

I wait ten more seconds.

…

…

..

I take the silence as a signal to open the door.

“Arthur, buddy. Are you hungry?”

Arthur lies on his bed. I assume he’s sleeping.

He looks peaceful, in a way I’ve never really seen before.

His phone lies on the floor. The screen is dark.

Nothing moves.

I envy him.

“Sorry, Arthur. Good night,” I say softly.

I’ll leave some for him. He’ll wake up eventually.

And if he doesn’t?

That’s fine.
