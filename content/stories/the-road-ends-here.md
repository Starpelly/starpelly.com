I used to wait by the school gates, clutching my backpack straps, watching the other kids leave one by one. When Mom's car finally pulled up, I'd run to it like it was the best part of my day. Because it was.

Mom was always so excited to see me. It was usually the only time she got to. She was always working. Some days she'd ask me how my day was, other days she wouldn't say anything at all. That was just how things were, for as long as I could remember.

But starting a few months ago, she began saying things I didn’t really understand.

Sometimes, as we sat at a red light or pulled into the driveway, she would start mumbling under her breath. It was never loud enough to make out, just this soft string of words that didn’t seem meant for me.

“Mom, are you okay?” I asked one time, when her eyes stayed fixed on the steering wheel a little too long.

She blinked, like she’d forgotten I was there. Then she smiled, too wide.

“Oh, yeah! Mom’s okay. Just thinking about boring adult stuff. Nothing involving you!”

She always said it like that, like it was supposed to make me feel better. But it didn’t.

When I left the car, Mom would always _beg_ for a big hug. She’d squeeze me like she hadn’t seen me in years, even if it had only been a day. Then she’d shoo me toward the front door with that same too-bright smile. Before I even made it inside, I’d hear the tires rolling away fast, like she couldn’t stand still for too long.

Dad was usually at his desk when I got home, staring at his computer with that scrunched-up look he always had when something wasn’t going right. He seemed stressed a lot, but when he saw me, his whole face changed. He’d smile big and call me over. Most nights, he’d make me dinner; simple stuff, but I liked it.

We talked a lot during dinner. He’d ask me about school, what I was learning, who I sat with at lunch. Stuff like that. It was nice, like he really wanted to hear everything.

One night, I asked him why Mom was never home. He froze for just a second, then gave me the same answer she always did.

“She’s working hard. For us.”

He smiled, but it didn’t reach his eyes. I didn’t ask again.

* * *

One day, Mom looked worse than usual. Her eyes were red, and her voice had that shaky edge, like holding it in was starting to hurt.

We were driving near the cliffs, the part of the road that always made my stomach twist a little. I tried not to look out the window.

She must’ve noticed, because suddenly, she perked up just a bit.

“Hey,” she said, nudging me lightly with her elbow, “did I ever tell you our car has a secret?”

I blinked. “A secret?”

“Mhm.” She pointed down toward the water. “See that ship down there?”

“Yeah?”

“Well... our car can do that too. It can sail.”

“What? How?” I asked, leaning forward, suddenly curious.

She grinned, a little crooked. “It just needs the right momentum.”

“Momentum?”

She laughed, for real, this time. “It means going fast enough. Like, _really fast_. Then it just sort of glides over the water like a boat. Cool, right?”

I stared at her, eyes wide. “That’s awesome.”

“Yeah,” she said, still smiling. “But you can’t tell anyone, okay?”

“Why not?”

“Because they wouldn’t believe you. And if they knew, someone might try it. And this car only works like that for us.”

I nodded seriously. “Okay. I won’t tell.”

She looked back at the road, quiet again, but softer now.

* * *

When we got home, I couldn’t wait to tell Dad. I kicked off my shoes, ran straight to his desk, and blurted it out before he even turned around.

“Dad! Did you know Mom said the car can sail if it goes fast enough?”

He spun in his chair, raising an eyebrow. “Sail?”

I nodded, bouncing on my toes. “Yeah! Like a boat! But only if you go really fast and get the momentum just right. She said it’s a secret, though. We’re not supposed to tell anyone.”

He let out a short laugh, rubbing the back of his neck. “Oh yeah? That’s pretty wild.”

I grinned. “She said it only works for our family.”

He smiled, that tired kind of smile adults get when they’re not sure what’s going on but don’t want to ruin the fun. “Well, I guess we better keep it a secret then, huh? Special family sailing car. Got it.”

I nodded solemnly, feeling proud to be in on something so important.

He turned back to his computer, still smiling a little to himself.

That night at dinner, I couldn’t stop thinking about it; the idea of our car sailing across the water like a ship. It sounded amazing. And scary. But mostly amazing.

I pushed my food around a little before finally asking, “Dad… when do you think we’ll get to do it?”

He looked up from his plate. “Do what?”

“Sail the car,” I said, trying to sound casual even though my stomach was twisting a little. “You know, like Mom said. With the momentum.”

He paused with his fork halfway to his mouth, then gave a quiet chuckle. “Oh. That.”

He set the fork down and leaned back in his chair. “Well… probably not for a long time. You need the perfect conditions, you know? Right speed, right angle, no traffic... Very technical stuff.”

I nodded slowly, trying to imagine what those conditions might look like.

“So maybe when I’m older?” I asked.

“Yeah,” he said, smiling. “When you’re older.”

I looked down at my plate, not quite satisfied, but trying to believe him. If it was that special, I could wait.

* * *

Two months passed, and things mostly stayed the same. Mom picked me up from school every day, just like always. Some days we talked. Some days we didn’t. That was normal.

I climbed into the car like I always did, tossing my backpack in the backseat. But this time, something was different.

There was a laptop open on the passenger seat, angled just enough so I could see a little of the screen. An email window. Mom didn’t say anything about it. She didn’t say much at all.

That wasn’t too strange. Sometimes she was quiet. I figured she must’ve been working again, she was always working.

We started driving. I glanced out the window, not paying much attention. But every time we came to a stop, a red light, a stop sign, she’d reach for the laptop. Her fingers tapped quickly, quietly. Then she’d drive again like nothing happened.

This went on for a while. Stop, type. Drive. Stop, type.

Then, at one long red light, I saw her click something.

She stared at the screen a moment longer than usual, then clicked the big blue button labeled 'Send.'

And she took a deep breath.

We drove in silence for a while after that. Mom didn’t reach for the laptop again. Her eyes stayed on the road, hands tight around the wheel.

Eventually, instead of turning toward home, she kept going, past the usual streets, past the stores, past the places I recognized.

She pulled over near the end, where the pavement met a guardrail and the horizon stretched out forever. The engine idled, then went quiet as she turned the key.

I looked over at her. “Mom? What’s wrong?”

She didn’t answer right away. Her eyes were fixed ahead, watching the horizon. The light from the sun nearing close to dawn caught the side of her face, and I could see it. The faint tension in her jaw. The way her bottom lip trembled for just a second before she pressed it flat. Her nose twitched like she might cry again, then she blinked quickly, like she’d just remembered I was there.

“Hey,” she said softly, her voice suddenly light, almost playful. “Wanna do it?”

“Do what?” I asked, confused.

She looked at me with that smile again. This time it held, but her eyes didn’t match it. They were glassy, far-off, like she was trying hard not to blink too fast.

“Do you remember what I told you a while back? About the car?”

My eyes lit up. “That it can sail?”

She nodded slowly. Her voice wavered just a little as she said, “Do you… do you want to try it today?”

My heart leapt. “Really? You mean it?”

She nodded again, and this time her smile almost looked real. But I didn’t notice how she turned her face just slightly away from me, like she didn’t want me to see her expression too clearly.

I didn’t notice how her eyes glistened when she looked out toward the ocean.

“Yes!” I said, practically bouncing in my seat. “Let’s do it!”

She reached over and brushed a hand through my hair. “Okay,” she said softly. “Okay, sweetheart.”

The car was quiet again as Mom started it back up. She didn’t speak, but her hands were trembling slightly as she shifted into reverse. The tires crunched softly over gravel as we rolled backward down the narrow road.

I looked out the window, watching us inch away from the cliff’s edge. “You said it needs momentum, right?” I asked, turning to her. “That’s why we’re going backwards?”

Her fingers tightened around the steering wheel. She nodded once, almost too quickly. “Yeah. That’s right.”

“That’s so smart,” I said, smiling. “I didn’t even think of that.”

She tried to smile back, but her lips just twitched and pressed together again. Her throat moved as she swallowed hard.

We kept rolling backward, farther than I thought we needed to, until the trees behind us started to thin out. Then she stopped. The silence inside the car was thick now, like everything was holding its breath.

She didn’t move for a second. Her eyes were forward again, staring at the curve of road ahead that ended in open sky and ocean far below.

“Are you okay?” I asked softly.

She nodded again, slower this time. But her eyes didn’t blink.

“You sure?” I added. “You look kind of… nervous.”

She turned to me, finally, and this time she did smile. But it was fragile, like something pulled too tight and about to snap. “I’m okay, sweetheart,” she said. “Just thinking.”

I nodded, satisfied, and looked forward, excitement bubbling in my chest. “This is gonna be awesome.”

She looked at me for another moment longer. Then, without a word, she turned back to the wheel, rested her foot on the pedal, and took one long, shaking breath.

* * *

“Go, Mom! Go!” I shouted, bouncing in my seat, grinning. “Let’s sail!”

Mom was staring forward, not blinking. Her hands shook on the wheel, and I thought maybe she was cold. Then I saw her shoulders moving — slowly at first, then more. Like she was breathing too hard.

She started crying. Quiet at first, then all at once, like she couldn’t stop it anymore. I didn’t really notice it at first, not with how excited I was.

And then, she slammed her foot down.

The car jolted forward with a roar. My back pressed into the seat. The wind from the open window rushed around me, and my heart soared.

We sped toward the cliff. The edge got closer and closer, and then we were flying.

For a second, I thought we really were sailing.

Then we hit the water.

The car slammed into it hard. Not hard enough to break anything, but enough to feel it deep in my stomach. I felt my head knock against the ceiling, or maybe the window, but I didn’t really notice. It just felt like a bump, and everything was moving so fast.

The car bounced, kind of floated, and then started settling. I looked around, wide-eyed.

“Why aren’t we sailing?” I asked, sitting up in my seat. “What’s going on?”

Mom didn’t answer. She stared ahead, frozen. Her shoulders stopped moving. Her breath, heavy just moments ago, was gone.

Then she turned to me. Her face was pale and wet. Her forehead was bleeding a little, already swelling.

 _“I’m sorry,”_ she whispered. It was quiet. Fragile. Like her voice barely made it past her lips.

She reached for me and pulled me close, fast. Her arms wrapped around me and held me tight.

I heard a sound. A strange one, like a bubbling, sucking noise. I looked down. Water. It was rushing in fast now, seeping through the doors, the dashboard. My shoes were already wet.

I tried to say something, but my mouth didn’t move right. Everything felt floaty. Slow.

Mom was still holding me. Sobbing now, into my shoulder. I felt her tears on my neck. Her voice was saying something, but it was muffled, far away.

My eyes blinked slower. My head felt heavy. The last thing I saw was the dashboard lights flickering under the waterline.

And then, everything went dark.
