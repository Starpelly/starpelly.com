Hi, I made this site cause I had the domain and the old site looked boring as hell.
I'm a visual effects artist and computer programmer. I'm an American interested in making and sharing open source software and video games.

I'm also a devout Christian and I might make a few posts about theology.

# Work

I have been creating video games and software since I was about 13 years old. And I haven't really been able to stop since.

My most notable work is Heaven Studio, a free and open-source level editor based on the Rhythm Heaven franchise. I started the project
in my mom's basement using nothing but Unity and my hopes and dreams. And I face the consequences of that decision every day.

I'd prefer to have a 100% ad-free website. We aren't consoomers around here.
